# Feed Tables

Feed tables provide lightweight parsers for Google Spreadsheets data available as a table in cells feed or list feed JSON data formats.
Feed tables work for both Node.js and a client-side JavaScript. Loading the data is out of the scope of this library, the sample code below shows how you can load the data in Node.js 
and in a browser by using JSONP. You can, however, use any other mechanism to access the data including authorization mechanisms. 

### Spreadsheet data

You must have a Google spreadsheet ready. For example, a <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AoooUkEfVrhldEpRekRVakVYWmJ2U2Z4SFBVZ0M1Nnc">sample data</a>
contains data about people such as for every person in the table there is a name, a street, and a city. 
In order to use this data, you can access it
as an atom feed in JSON format either as a <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/0AoooUkEfVrhldEpRekRVakVYWmJ2U2Z4SFBVZ0M1Nnc/od6/public/basic?alt=json">list feed</a> or a <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/cells/0AoooUkEfVrhldEpRekRVakVYWmJ2U2Z4SFBVZ0M1Nnc/od6/public/basic?alt=json">cells feed</a>. Note that in order to access a spreadsheet data at such URLs without any authorization, 
you need to publish your spreadsheet as a Web page (in Google Spreadsheet go to Share -> Publish as a Web Page).

## Usage in Node.js

### Installation

    npm install feed-tables

### Loading the data 

First, you need to load the data from the spreadsheet. In Node.js, you can use
http and url libraries and the following `receive` function:

```js
var http = require('http');
var url = require('url');

var receive = function(dataUrl, dataReady) {
    var urlp = url.parse(dataUrl);
    var service = http.createClient(urlp.port ? urlp.port : 80, urlp.hostname);
    var req = service.request('GET', urlp.pathname + urlp.search,
        {'host': urlp.hostname});

    var data = null, status = null, finished = false;

    req.on('response', function (res) {
        var body = "";
        status = res.statusCode;

        res.on('data', function (chunk) {
            body += chunk;
        });

        res.on('end', function () {
            data = JSON.parse(body);
            if (!finished) {
                finished = true;
                dataReady(data);
            }
        });
    });

    req.end();

    setTimeout(function() {
        if (!finished) {
            finished = true;
            dataReady(null);
        }
    }, 2000);
};
```

### Parsing the data

You can use either `CellsFeed` or `ListFeed` parser to parse the data. This depends on the format
of the spreadsheet you want to use. Cells feeds are larger as every spreadsheet cell data 
is in a separated atom feed entry. The `CellsFeed` parser expects that there are names of header fields 
in the first row of the spreadsheet. 

The following code shows how to use the `CellsFeed` parser.

```js
var ft = require('feed-tables');

receive("https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/cells/0AoooUkEfVrhldEpRekRVakVYWmJ2U2Z4SFBVZ0M1Nnc/od6/public/basic?alt=json",
 function(data) {
        if (data) {
            var table = new ft.CellsFeed(data);            
            for (var r = 0; r < table.length; r++) {
                var row = table.getRow(r);
                console.log("name: " + row.name + ", street: " + row.street, " city: " + row.city + "\n");
            }
        } else
            console.log("Timeout while fetching the Google Spreadsheet data.");
    });
```

List feeds are much smaller in size as every atom feed entry contains a single row, however, this format
does not contain a row with all the table's header field names, hence you need to provide 
the header field names expicitly when creating the parser. 

To create the `ListFeed` parser you need to use the List feed url https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/0AoooUkEfVrhldEpRekRVakVYWmJ2U2Z4SFBVZ0M1Nnc/od6/public/basic?alt=json 
when retrieving the spreadsheet data and the following code

```js
var table = new ft.ListFeed(data, ["name", "street", "city"]);            
```
## Usage in a browser

JSFiddle example: https://jsfiddle.net/ryk74cnv/

In a browser you can load the data either by using XMLHttpRequest or JSONP. Google spreadsheets
supports both options including Cross-Origin Resource Sharing if you use XHR. Following code
shows how to load the data using JSONP for which you need to add `callback` parameter at the end of 
the spreadsheet url. You also need to have `feed-tables.js` included in your document.

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <!-- ... -->
        <script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/your/feed-tables.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <script>
            var URL = "https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/0AoooUkEfVrhldEpRekRVakVYWmJ2U2Z4SFBVZ0M1Nnc/od6/public/basic?alt=json&callback=dataReady";
            
            function loadData() {
                var scp = document.createElement('script');
            	scp.setAttribute("type","text/javascript");
            	scp.setAttribute("src", URL);	
            	document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(scp);	
            }
            
            function dataReady(data) {
                var table = new ListFeed(data, ["name", "street", "city"]);
                for (var r = 0; r < table.length; r++) {
                    var row = table.getRow(r);
                    // access data here row.name, row.street, row.city
                    // add them to your HTML code
                }
            }
        </script>
        <!-- ... -->
    </body>
</html>
```
